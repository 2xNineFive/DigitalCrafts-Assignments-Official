# API 302

## We use *HTTPS verbs* to describe API requests.
## We use *nouns* to refer to the data they handle.
P.s. nouns do not really exist. 

<br>

### HTTP Verbs
There are four verbs. Together, we sometimes refer to what they do as *CRUD* operations 
- create
- read
- update
- delete

<br>

### Nounds
These describe the data and are usually preceded by a `/`. Examples below.
- `/contacts`
- `/users`
- `/photos`
- `/countries`
