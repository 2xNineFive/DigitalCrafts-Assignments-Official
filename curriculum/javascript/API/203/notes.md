### Terms
**`async`**

**`await`**
A keyword we use to prefix the name of a function which calls async code and in which the response is cached. This keyword must be used inside of another function that is prefixed with `async`.



**`.catch`**
A method chained to the response object to which we supply a callback function to handle errors.
