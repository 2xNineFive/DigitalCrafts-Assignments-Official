# API 303

## There are many different types of HTTP requests but you will deal with just five of them. 

### Common HTTP requests

**`DELETE`**
to delete data


**`GET`**
to retreive data 


**`PATCH`**
to update data by overwriting only a part of a larger data set

**`POST`**
to create new data 


**`PUT`**
to update data by overwriting everything that is in the data set



Note: **`PATCH`** and **`PUT`** are similar but our practices will concentrate on **`PUT`**
