# API 101
## API's keep us from reinventing the wheel

### API Definition
An Application Programming Interface has one of two forms: 
- data exposed by a provider
- methods exposed by another developer or group of developers 
If we consume a data API, we have to understand promises since data is delivered asynchronously.

### Summary
An API is a database created by a provider that other developers can use. The API will contain tons of data that can be used in another website.
