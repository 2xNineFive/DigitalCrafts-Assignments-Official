# Objects

## Why are objects useful?
Objects are useful because they allow programmers to store multiple sets of information that describe a single thing. 

## What is an object?
An object is a collection of multiple unique attributes that describe a single thing. 
```javascript```
const 

In an object, each attribute and its descriptor are paired into `key:value` pairs. Javascript views the `key` as a `string` by default so quotation marks around the key are unneccessary.
